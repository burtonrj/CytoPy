"""
When creating training data for supervised classification it can be useful
to generate a new example FileGroup by sampling many or all the FileGroups
present in an Experiment. This can also be useful if we have suitable data
to be modelled as after concatenation of all available events (say the data
was all measured within the same batch). This module contains the
create_ref_sample function for merging multiple FileGroups to form
a new FileGroup saved to the experiment.

    Given some experiment and a root population that is common to all fcs file groups within this experiment, take
    a sample from each and create a new file group from the concatenation of these data. New file group will be created

    -----------
    experiment: FCSExperiment
        FCSExperiment object for corresponding experiment to sample
    root_population: str

        list of sample IDs for samples to be included (default = all samples in experiment)
    new_file_name: str
        name of file group generated

        number or fraction of events to sample from each file
