Here you will find cytopy's implementation of the FlowSOM algorithm, which
relies on the MiniSOM library for self-organising maps. The work was
adapted from https://github.com/Hatchin/FlowSOM for integration with cytopy and
the database architecture.

class FlowSOM:
    """
    Python implementation of FlowSOM algorithm, adapted from https://github.com/Hatchin/FlowSOM
    This class implements MiniSOM in an almost identical manner to the work by Hatchin, but removed all the
    of the data handling steps seen in Hatchin's original library, since these are handled by the infrastructure in
    cytopy. The FlowSOM algorithm is implemented here in such a way that it requires only a Pandas DataFrame,
    like that typically produced when retrieving data from the cytopy database, and gives access to methods
    of clustering and meta-clustering. In addition to Hatchin's work, the cytopy implementation has improved error
    handling and integrates better with the cytopy workflow.
